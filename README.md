# blackjack

simple black jack simulator

things to fix:
  if user gets multiple ace's thier hands can have multiple values 
    *ex HA DA CA H5 
      thier hand can be valued at 11+11+11+5 || 11+11+1+5 || 11+1+1+5 || 1+1+1+5 etc*
   maybe create a dealer class or implement inheratance so dealer inheraites player functions
  
  things to implement:
  fully working dealer that makes decisions based on user cards and current cards
